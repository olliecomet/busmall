# BusMall User Stories

## Goal: Help BusMall employees gather market research on products

### Personas:

Alexis is a PSU student who commutes from Gresham. She is most interested in finding ways to pass the time during the long commute. Because she's a student on a budget, she's more interested in browsing than buying.

Natalie is one of the market researchers for BusMall and has recently moved from out of state. She wants the app to collect and cleanly present relevant data. She also wants a way to compare Portland's data to data she's collected from other states.

Kim is a tourist from out of state who is enjoying taking public transit and wants to buy souvenirs to commemorate her trip. She's heard stories about how "weird" Portland is and wants to buy items that carry a story. She wants the app to display prices and a description when they're displayed. 

### MVP: 

As someone who's collecting data, Natalie wants the app to store and display data in an easy to digest manner.

As someone who's just looking to pass the time, Alexis wants something easy to look at and simple to interact with.

As someone who's looking to buy things, Kim wants to see info on the products available.

### Stretch Goals:

Natalie wants to be able to show any number of products to the user at once to see if that changes the results.

Natalie wants to be able to add new products and remove ones that aren't doing well. 

Kim wants to be able to see prices and descriptions of items to know if she'll buy them or not. 

In case Kim leaves before being able to purchase something from BusMall, she wants the option to subscribe to the magazine mailing list and order products from the app.
